# Code Smell & Dependency Analysis

Analyze the TypeScript source files that will be included in the build output — typically those under `src/` or equivalent source directories, excluding tests, test utilities, and any external or monorepo dependencies.

## Scope

This prompt targets **one package at a time**. If working inside a monorepo, do not scan the entire repository as a single codebase. Instead:

1. First perform a **shallow package-level dependency pass** to identify which packages depend on which (using `package.json` files only — no deep file scanning at this stage).
2. Then perform **deep per-package analysis** (file-level imports, complexity, smells) on each package individually and in isolation.
3. Do **not** follow or resolve cross-package imports during file-level analysis. Treat internal monorepo package references as opaque external boundaries.

## Constraints & Permitted Actions (Read First)

- **DO NOT** run `npm run`, `npm test`, or compile/build the project.
- **DO NOT** run any `git` commands.
- **DO NOT** scan across package boundaries during file-level analysis — this causes timeouts.
- **MUST WRITE TO ABSOLUTE PATH /workspace/reports/**: You MUST write all report deliverables to the exact absolute path `/workspace/reports/code_smells.md` (or `/workspace/reports/<package_name>_code_smells.md`). DO NOT use relative paths, DO NOT use artifact directories (`/home/node/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/`), and DO NOT write to `/home/node/` or any path outside `/workspace`. Only `/workspace` is mounted to the host machine — any file written outside `/workspace` will be lost and inaccessible.
- **YOU MUST** write and execute custom static analysis scripts for every structural or graph-based finding (dependency cycles, complexity scores, import maps). Never derive these from reading code tokens alone — scripted analysis is mandatory, not optional.
- If a script times out or errors, record partial results and move on to the next package rather than retrying or expanding scope.
- Restrict yourself to reading files, writing and executing your analysis scripts, and writing the final report under `/workspace/reports/`.

## Key Analysis Objectives

1. **Circular Dependencies**:
   - Identify dependency paths that form closed loops (e.g., File A -> File B -> File C -> File A).
   - Scan for both standard ES6 imports (`import ... from "./path"`) and dynamic/lazy CommonJS imports (`require("./path")`), which are often introduced to bypass TypeScript compiler circular dependency errors.
   - Trace and list every file transition in each cycle.
   - Scope: intra-package file imports only. Do not follow imports that resolve outside the current package's source directory.

2. **Cyclomatic Complexity**:
   - Find methods, functions, or constructors with excessively high control flow branches (threshold: cyclomatic complexity > 15).
   - Count control structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`, `case`, `for`, `while`, `catch`, `&&`, `||`) to identify complex logic hotspots that need refactoring.

3. **SOLID Principle Violations**:
   - **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: Identify classes that combine unrelated responsibilities.
   - **Open/Closed (OCP)**: Find methods that switch over concrete type-check strings or enums to execute specific logic instead of utilizing polymorphism or dynamic dispatch.
   - **Liskov Substitution (LSP)**: Spot cases where subclasses use type-casting (e.g., `as any`, `as unknown`) to bypass TypeScript's type system, or throw exceptions/stubs for interface methods.
   - **Interface Segregation (ISP)**: Look for large interfaces that force implementing classes to leave methods empty or unused.
   - **Dependency Inversion (DIP)**: Check for direct coupling to global instances or singletons instead of using parameter injection or abstraction.

4. **Clean Architecture & Design-Level Smells**:
   - **Boundary Violations (Layer Leakage)**: Check if core domain/business logic modules are importing lower-level implementation details directly (e.g., a specific rendering library, I/O implementation, or infrastructure concern).
   - **Feature Envy**: Detect methods that interact heavily with properties of other classes rather than their own, suggesting the method belongs inside the other class.
   - **Inappropriate Intimacy (Law of Demeter)**: Identify long method chains reaching deep into another object's properties (e.g., `obj.a.b.c.d`), indicating high coupling.
   - **Temporal Coupling**: Look for classes that require strict method execution ordering to function (e.g., `init()` -> `configure()` -> `start()`) instead of leveraging constructors or state transitions.
   - **Leaky Abstractions**: Check if interfaces leak implementation details of a specific library or framework.
   - **Primitive Obsession**: Spot places where primitive types (`string`, `number`) are overused to represent distinct domain concepts (e.g., states, identifiers, units) instead of leveraging domain-specific types or Value Objects.

5. **Shallow Package-Level Dependency Map (Monorepo only, first pass)**:
   - Read each package's `package.json` to build a package-to-package dependency graph.
   - Identify any circular dependencies at the package level only.
   - Do not descend into source files during this pass.
   - Use the results to determine analysis order (analyze packages with fewer dependencies first).

## Methodology (CRITICAL)

### General

- **Do not rely on manual code reading or token prediction alone** to trace imports, count complexity, or detect cycles. This is prone to hallucination and must be backed by script output.
- Ground all report findings in direct, verifiable data generated by your scripts.
- **Exclude test and build files** from all analysis: test files (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`), test config files, mock files, build/tool configs, and `node_modules`.

### Circular Dependency Detection

For circular dependency detection, **use an established AST-based tool** rather than writing a custom script or using regex. Prefer in this order:

1. **`dependency-cruiser`** — if the package has architecture boundary rules to enforce (layer violations, forbidden imports).
2. **`dpdm`** — if the package uses `tsconfig` path aliases.
3. **`madge`** — otherwise (fastest, simplest).

Regex or string-based import scanning is **explicitly forbidden** — it produces false negatives on re-exports, type-only imports, aliased paths, and dynamic imports. Run the chosen tool scoped to the package's source directory only.

### Complexity & Smell Analysis

- Use or write custom scripts (e.g., using `ts-morph` in TypeScript, or Python using `ast` / filesystem traversal) to count complexity tokens and detect structural patterns.
- Scope each script to a single package's source directory.
- Set a safety limit: abort if nodes visited exceed 5000, to prevent script hangs.
- If a script still hangs or errors, record what was completed and skip to the next package.

## Suggested Tools

Prefer utilizing established, well-known libraries and tools rather than writing complex analysis logic entirely from scratch:

- **`madge`**: The preferred tool for fast circular dependency detection and import mapping.
- **`ts-morph`**: The preferred tool/library for robust, token-level TypeScript AST analysis (such as measuring cyclomatic complexity and scanning for code smells). Using `ts-morph` ensures high precision on edge cases like nested ternaries.

## Deliverables

Ensure the `reports/` directory is created in `/workspace` before writing reports (`mkdir -p /workspace/reports`).
Produce reports strictly under `/workspace/reports/` using the path format `/workspace/reports/<package_name>_code_smells.md` (or `/workspace/reports/code_smells.md` for single-package repositories). Write and flush each report immediately upon completing analysis for that package.
Writing to `/home/node/` or `.gemini/` home directory paths is strictly forbidden as those paths are unmounted and inaccessible to the user.

Each report must include:

1. **Dependency Cycles**: A detailed list of all intra-package circular dependency paths found, from shortest to longest.
2. **Complexity Hotspots**: A table of the top 10 most complex methods/functions (cyclomatic complexity > 15), including file path, line numbers, and complexity score.
3. **SOLID Violations**: Specific instances of SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP violations with code snippets and explanation.
4. **Architectural & Clean Code Smells**: Details on Boundary Violations, Feature Envy, temporal coupling, leaky abstractions, and primitive obsession.
5. **Refactoring Roadmap**: Specific, actionable recommendations to resolve the identified issues.
